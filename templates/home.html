  <h1>Welcome to {{name}}</h1>
  <p>
    The <strong>{{name}}</strong> is a robust web application designed for comprehensive text analysis and cleaning. It provides real-time metrics, including word counts, character counts, and advanced frequency analysis through interactive visualizations.

    <h2>The Stack</h2>
    <p>This project is built using a modern Python-based web stack:</p>
    <ul class="tech-lists">
      <li class="tech"><strong>Python:</strong> The core language used for all text processing logic.</li>
      <li class="tech"><strong>Flask:</strong> A lightweight WSGI web application framework for routing and server-side logic.</li>
      <li class="tech"><strong>NLTK:</strong> The Natural Language Toolkit for advanced tokenization and stop-word filtering.</li>
      <li class="tech"><strong>Jinja2:</strong> For dynamic HTML templating.</li>
      <li class="tech"><strong>Chart.js:</strong> Powering the interactive Zipf's Law and frequency charts.</li>
      <li class="tech"><strong>CSS:</strong> Custom responsive styling.</li>

    <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
    <p>To ensure maintainability and scalability, the application leverages several key design patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pipeline Pattern:</strong> The text processing engine is built as a flexible pipeline. You can dynamically add or remove processing steps (like lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, etc.) without affecting the overall structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Functional Step Pattern:</strong> Each transformation in the pipeline is a discrete, pure function. This modular approach makes testing and extending the processing logic straightforward.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MVC (Model-View-Controller):</strong> The application logic is separated into <code>services</code> (the Model/logic), <code>templates</code> (the View), and <code>app.py</code> (the Controller).
      </li>
    </ul>
