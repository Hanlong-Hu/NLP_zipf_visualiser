    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>{{name}}</strong> is a tool designed for linguistic analysis and data preparation. It serves as a playground for understanding how text normalization impacts data metrics.

    <h2>Mathematical Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      The application utilizes <strong>Zipf's Law</strong> to visualize word frequency distribution. Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
      \[ f(k; s, N) = \frac{1/k^s}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} (1/n^s)} \]
      Where:
      <ul>
        <li>\( k \) is the rank of the word.</li>
        <li>\( s \) is the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.</li>
        <li>\( N \) is the number of elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Pipeline Logic</h2>
    <p>
      The core processing pipeline follows a linear transformation model:
      \[ T_{final} = S_n(S_{n-1}(...S_1(T_{raw})...)) \]
      Each step \( S_i \) is a discrete transformation applied to the text tokens, allowing for modular and testable code.

    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Raw text is broken down into individual words (tokens) using NLTK's <code>word_tokenize</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Depending on user selection, punctuation is removed, and non-alphabetic characters are filtered.</li>
      <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Text is optionally converted to lowercase to ensure uniform counting.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Word Removal:</strong> Common "filler" words (e.g., "the", "is", "at") can be removed to focus on meaningful content.</li>
      <li><strong>Metrics Generation:</strong> The final processed list of words is used to calculate counts and frequency distributions.</li>
    </ol>
